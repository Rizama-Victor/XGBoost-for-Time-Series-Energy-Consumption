# XGBoost ⚡ for Time Series ⏳ Energy Consumption
This repository contains the implementation of the project titled _"XGBoost for Time Series Energy Consumption"_, at the Department of Mechatronics Engineering (DOME), Federal University of Technology Minna (FUTMinna), Nigeria.

--- 
## 🕒 Project Overview

This project focused on forecasting time-series energy consumption using historical housedold residential usage data recorded at regular intervals. Energy consumption naturally fluctuates based on factors such as time of day, weather, seasonal variations, and human or industrial activity. Understanding these patterns is essential for effective planning in sectors especially residential energy management. 
To support more efficient resource allocation, this project developed a machine learning model using XGBoost to predict future energy usage based on past trends, enabling more informed and proactive energy management decisions.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- To curate and preprocess a clean and structured time-series energy consumption dataset suitable for forecasting.
- To develop and train an XGBoost-based predictive model capable of learning patterns and trends in historical energy usage.
- To assess the model’s performance using appropriate evaluation metrics and optimize it for accurate and reliable energy consumption forecasting.
